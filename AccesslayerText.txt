The Data Access Layer (DAL) is responsible for managing various data flows from diverse sources, ensuring that all incoming data is accurately processed and stored within the system.
The DataListener classis an entry point for receiving data from external sources. It includes methods for connections with different types of data sources, such as TCP/IP, WebSocket, or files. Depending on the type of data source, specific subclasses like TCPDataListener, WebSocketDataListener, and FileDataListener are implemented to handle the communication protocols and data reception mechanisms associated with each source.
The DataParser class standardizes the raw data into a uniform format. This class is responsible for parsing and transforming the data, ensuring consistency and compatibility. Methods within the DataParser class handle tasks such as parsing data formats (e.g., JSON, CSV) and transforming data structures to meet system requirements.
The standardized data is then passed to the DataSourceAdapter, which performs additional processing and validation before storing it in the system's data storage component. The DataSourceAdapter class includes methods for validating data integrity and storing the processed data securely within the Data Storage System.
