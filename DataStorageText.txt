The DataStorage class serves as the core component responsible for storing, retrieving, and deleting patient data. It has a map structure (patientDataMap) to organize patient data efficiently. The class implements interfaces for data storage and encryption (IDataStorage and IDataEncryption) to ensure that data is stored securely, with methods to encrypt and decrypt sensitive information.
The PatientData class represents individual data points for each patient, containing essential attributes such as patient ID, metrics, and timestamp. The class provides getter methods to access these attributes securely.
The DataRetriever class does data retrieval operations. It implements the IDataRetriever interface, which defines a method for retrieving patient data based on the patient ID.
The SecurityManager class controls access to patient data by authenticating users and authorizing their access based on their roles and patient IDs. It implements the ISecurityManager interface, with methods for user authentication.
The associations between these classes ensure communication and data flow within the Data Storage System. For example, the AlertGenerator class interacts with the DataStorage class to fetch historical patient data for real-time analysis.
