The AlertGenerator is responsible for processing patient data and triggering alerts when necessary. This class interacts with various monitoring devices, such as HeartRateMonitor and BloodPressureCuff and they receive real-time data streams. Each device is associated with the PatientData class. This class gives information about a patient's vital signs.
The AlertGenerator evaluates incoming data for thresholds to determine if an alert should be generated. It caches patient data for processing and interacts with the AlertManager to handle alert distribution. The AlertManager manages the alert queue and ensures alerts are sent to medical staff.
The Alert class represents an individual alert. This contains information such as the patient ID, the specific condition triggering the alert, and the timestamp. This class encapsulates the information needed to notify medical staff about potential health risks.
The BloodPressure class represents blood pressure measurements, which are an essential component of patient data. Both BloodPressureCuff and HeartRateMonitor classes provide methods to retrieve and set relevant data.
The associations determine the flow in the system. For example, the AlertGenerator has a relationship with PatientData. It processes data from multiple patients. Associations between the AlertGenerator and monitoring devices signify data reception and processing.
