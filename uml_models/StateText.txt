The process begins when the system detects patient data exceeding predefined threshold criteria, transitioning the alert to the "Generated" state. The system checks the patient data to confirm that it meets the criteria for generating an alert. If the condition is met, the alert transitions to the "Sent" state, where it is dispatched to designated medical staff for immediate attention.
Medical staff can acknowledge the alert by clicking on it or opening the patient's detailed view on their device. This manual acknowledgment ensures that the medical staff is aware of the situation. Once the alert is acknowledged, it moves to the "Acknowledged" state, indicating that the medical staff has seen and taken note of the alert. 
The alert then enters the "Resolved" state, where it can be resolved either automatically or manually. Automatic resolution occurs when patient data shows normal readings for a predefined period, suggesting that the condition has stabilized. Manual resolution involves medical staff assessing the patient's condition and potentially adjusting treatment, confirming that the alert condition no longer exists.
